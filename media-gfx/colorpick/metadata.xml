	A color picker, which makes it easy to check text readability
	by letting you pick a background and foreground color and computing
	the contrast between them.
	It lets you know if contrast is good enough according to
	http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast.
	It also comes with a handy magnified-picker, which you can control
	with the cursor keys, for precise picking.
	Finally, it lets you adjust colors and copy them to the clipboard
	as different formats.
