	A ranged set is an ordered list of ranges.
	Ranged sets allow programming with sets of values that are described
	by a list of ranges.  A value is a member of the set if it lies within
	one of the ranges.  The ranges in a set are ordered and
	non-overlapping, so the standard set operations can be implemented by
	merge algorithms in O(n) time.
