	<longdescription lang="en">
	This package provides a piece of code stolen from Yury Sulsky which has been
	slightly modified/improved by myself. It sets up some reader macros that make
	it simpler to input string literals which contain backslashes and double quotes.
	This is very useful for writing complicated docstrings and, as it turns out,
	writing code that contains string literals that contain code themselves.
